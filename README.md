# **a simple yet clusterfucked ytdl wrapper**

a small console program that i wrote in C# (the second one in my life) to simplify the use of ytdl when i need it the most

# Available feature:
- A simple updater (you'll need to run this first as this won't include youtube-dl and ffmpeg out of the box)
- As of right now, only 3 modes are available: video & audio, audio-only, and all playlist.
- No UI, it's just a console application

# Run it
 - Double click on the executable, enter 5 in order to download both ytdl and ffmpeg binary
 - Voila!
# Build it
You will need to have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) in order to build this

You will also need [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) in order to get the extraction part of this working
